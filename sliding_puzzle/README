Sliding Puzzle problem:
Given initial state of the board, find move sequences to get sorted position

Implementation : A* algorithm
Enqueue all the nodes to be explored and explore based on a heurestic

(TODO)
Write basic outline of program with functions and debug routines
    Have a array for the heurestic
    An array for current state of the board
    Moves are to be stored? (To read implementation of A*)
Implementing the actual algorithm
(DONE)

The exact problem statement for the task 1 (sliding_puzzle) is :

Sliding puzzle problems are very standard problems studied in the field of Artificial
Intelligence. Details of the Fifteen problem (one of the sliding puzzle problems)
can be found here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifteen_puzzle. Your first task is to
write a program which solves this problem.
Given an initial (distorted) state of the board, find a sequence of moves which lead to
the "sorted" position of the board. Keep flexibility while writing the code so that we
can easily test your algorithm on any random initial state of the board.
