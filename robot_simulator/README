Task 2 : Robot Simulator

Imagine a "point" robot living in a two-dimensional world. The robot 
has a fixed velocity but it's orientation can be changed to any direction 
(say using a steering wheel).The robot also has a sensor which senses the
perpendicular distance of itself from the X-axis. The aim of the robot is 
to move along the positive x-axis while trying to keep its y-coordinate to
be zero. This is VERY similar to the line-follower robot! To follow the 
line, the robot uses a PID controller. Implement a program which simulates
the environment and the robot. Display the path travelled by your robot in
the simulated environment. Add some noise to the sensor measurement to 
remove the ideality. This would imply that the robot would a take 
different path each time you run your simulator.
